# Object of GFL and PFL 

In the realm of the image classification task, Federated Learning (FL) is broadly categorized into two branches: **Global Federated Learning (GFL)** and **Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)**. The objectives of each branch are as follows:

## Global Federated Learning (GFL)


Global Federated Learning (GFL) aims to enhance the performance of a single global model across decentralized clients by addressing data heterogeneity arising from diverse user behaviors. 


## Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)


Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) focuses on training personalized models for individual clients, adapting to their specific data distributions and tasks.
